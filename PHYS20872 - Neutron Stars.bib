  abstract = {We report on an undergraduate student project initiated in the summer semester of 2004 with the aim to establish equations of state for white dwarfs and neutron stars for computing mass-radius relations as well as corresponding maximum masses. First, white dwarfs are described by a Fermi gas model of degenerate electrons and neutrons and effects from general relativity are examined. For neutron star matter, the influence of a finite fraction of protons and electrons and of strong nucleon-nucleon interactions are studied. The nucleon--nucleon interactions are introduced within a Hartree-Fock scheme using a Skyrme-type interaction. Finally, masses and radii of neutron stars are computed for given central pressure.},
